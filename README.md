# TTPPD / Go Builds

This project is a showcase on three different strategies to build Go projects using makefiles:

- Single native executable (basic)
  - Building local native executables
  - Cleaning files
  - Testing the project
  - Code coverage and coverage visualization
- Explicit Multiple platform / single executable (intermediate)
  - Building executables for other platforms
- Dynamic Multiple platform / multiple executables (advanced)
  - Artifact packaging
  - Artifact checksums

The examples increase are listed in increasing complexity. The subtopics for every example are additive and include the ones from the previous example.
